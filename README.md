# Ratemaking Project
The goal of this project, undertaken at the undergraduate level, is: Pricing(Ratemaking) worker's compensation premiums using Actuarial Techniques. Actuarial Ratemaking or Pricing is one of the primary operations of an actuary. This process combines actuarial judgement and statistical techniques to determine the new premiums or rates to cover an insurer’s claims, expenses and other potential liabilities while maintaining profitability. It also ensures fairness and adequacy of coverage to the insured.

The dataset has been taken from Casualty Actuarial Society’s Research Resources, titled - “Loss Reserving Data Pulled from NAIC Schedule P”. The claims data comes from Schedule P – Analysis of Losses and Loss Expenses in the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) database. The dataset being used is the Workers’ Compensation dataset. (https://www.casact.org/publications-research/research/research-resources/loss-reserving-data-pulled-naic-schedule-p)

The language chosen for this project is the  python3 language. 

The outcome is the indicated rate change based on historical losses and premiums data and the core techniques being implemented are:
  -  Chain Ladder Technique and Generalized Linear Model (GLM) for Loss Development
  -  Parallelogram Method for adjusting Premiums and Losses for Rate and Benefit Changes
  -  Loss Ratio Method for finding overall indicated rate change

Additionally, I created a web application for this project using streamlit. The app is hosted on streamlit: https://ratemaking-with-python.streamlit.app/
